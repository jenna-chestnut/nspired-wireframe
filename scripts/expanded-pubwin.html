        <p>Don't be scared to just jump in. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn, and you'll never know everything! You just need to know where to look for the answers. Feel free to add me on twitter and we can support each other.  @Jennabot5000</p>
        <p>- Jenna</p>
        <p>It's not gonna be easy, but if you just keep at it and don't give up - it's really worth it in the end. AND TAKE BREAKS! Making sure that you rest is almost as important as the learning part.</p>
